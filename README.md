# wordSearch Challenge

This is a small Node.js CLI app that takes a grid file and a word search file, searches for each file in the grid and prints a list of words found.

This is my coding challenge for entry into NUVI.

# Installation

No installation needed, other than Node.js and NPM

# Challenge tasks

- [x] build only index.js
- [x] start framework of importing files
- [x] validate only valid letters in grid and word files
- [x] build logic to search each letter of search word in grid, searching up, down, left, right, diagonal-up-right, diagonal-up-left, diagonal-down-right, diagonal-down-left

## Next tasks

- [ ] debug why code won't capture and report found words
- [ ] debug outlying cases
- [ ] Include this repo on my [Portfolio Site](https://ne0crank.github.io/kentmschaeffer/)
